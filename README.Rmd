The asymptor R package allows you to estimate the lower and upper bound of
asymptomatic cases in an epidemic using the capture/recapture methods from
[BÃ¶hning et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.009) and
[Rocchetti et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153445).

## Installation

You can install the stable version of this package from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("asymptor")
```

or the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/bisaloo), via my 
[r-universe](https://bisaloo.r-universe.dev/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("asymptor", repos = "https://bisaloo.r-universe.dev")
```

## Example

Let's start by loading some example data from the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy:

```{r}
d <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "covid19_italy.rds", package = "asymptor"))
head(d)
```

We can estimate the lower and upper bound of asymptomatic cases with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(asymptor)
estimate_asympto(d$date, d$new_cases, d$new_deaths)
```

Or, with a tidyverse-compatible syntax:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
d %>%
  mutate(asympto_cases = estimate_asympto(date, new_cases, new_deaths))
```

Please refer to the
[vignette](https://bisaloo.github.io/asymptor/articles/example.html) for a
detailed example using the COVID-19 data from Italy.
